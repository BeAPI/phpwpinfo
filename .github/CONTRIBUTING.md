# Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Check if your issue has already been discussed (or even fixed) earlier. You can [search for existing issues](../../../issues?q=is%3Aissue).
* Assuming it does not already exist, [create a new issue](../../../issues/new).
  * Clearly describe the issue. In case you want to report a bug, include steps to reproduce it.
  * Make sure you fill in the requested details to provide as much information as possible.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

# Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the `master` branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on the `master` branch:
    * `git checkout -b issue/{issue-number} master`
    * a good example is `issue/7`
* Make commits of logical units and that messages are helpful.

# Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to the according topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* [Create a pull request](../../../compare) to our repository.
* Wait for feedback. The team looks at pull requests on a regular basis.
